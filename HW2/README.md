HW2 - PHYS661 - 25fall
This homework made use of two tasks: First was was calculating rudimentary probabilities based on the frequentist view of statistics. Second used a bayesian framework to plot distributions of two data sets but with different priors.

The result of the first task was expected and simply practice calculating simple probabilities. However, the second task was much more enlightening. The resulting plots showed a drastic change in the mode(s) and skew of the distributions. Although this was in retrospect easily explained, carrying out the actual calculation with qualitatively similar priors--gaussian and t distributions--had a significant effect on the results.
