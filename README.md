1. What is the reason you decided to take this class?
    I actually have a decent background in data science. However, this background is from self-education through previous research, tangentially related courses, and personal projects, so I took the course to gain a formal and fuller understanding of data science.
2. What do you hope to learn the most?
    Nothing in peticular. Moreso, I'm looking to fill in any gaps that I've missed from self-teaching.
3. What are the strengths in your background or character that you think will help you in the class?
    The solid data science foundation I have from previous self-teaching means that I can focus on peticular topics which I've had trouble with without getting bogged down in the main priciples.
