HW 9 plots reviewed by Alex Bruce

Old plot:

New plot:
<img width="768" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d420999-d294-4452-9e86-15aea5e3249c" />

The old plot does not have amiguity problems. I would say that the data is distracting in that the transparent layers make each distrubtion a little confusing. The layered data has the
dark areas show where both distribution is present but the addition of a new color adds confusion. The data itself is not distorted but needed to be represented differently. The new plot fixes this issue
simply by separating the data into different plots. The three plots use the same scale on the x and y axis, keeping the scale uniform, which is good. In the improved plot there is no more distraction issues except the
mean value (which is a nice addition) should not overlay the data (even when transparent). 

As mentioned before, the effect size is not an issue. Although the amount of space tripled, I think the usage of space is worth it considering how it was before. Also the addition of the mean on the x axis as well as its value
on the plot is useful. There is not much other stuff going on the plot, which is what I would expect for displaying a distribution. The lines across the marked values of the y axis are helpful for estimating by looking.
In this case, there are no color variations that are important in the new plots so color blindness should not be an issue.

Found bad plot:

This image has so much going on it is hard to understand. For starters, the left y axis is just an equation that does not list units. What is concerning is that this is different units
than the other y axis on the other side. At the same time, there are unlabeled log axis for each one. It is hard at first glance to tell the difference between the traingle and circle
icons on the lines because they are small, similar and that the lines cross over each other a lot.
