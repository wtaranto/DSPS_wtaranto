Will's splitting of his histogram plots into three vertically stacked sections is a good move, that definitely improves clarity and readability. Explcitly stating the mean values for each histogram alleviates a source of ambiguity. Having all three subplots share an x-axis does prevent distortions from occurring. Avoiding the multiple shades of the same color, as they occur in the original plot, eliminates a source of distraction.

The updated plot follows Tufte's 5 rules, for the most part. There is an effect size of 1, small multiples used, and there is virtually no chart junk. The plot depicts a managable (less than 7) number of distinct histograms. I do think that the data vs ink ratio is slightly off, however. There need only be one "Particle Number" label for the y-axis, as the y-axis for all three sections are capturing the same quantity. Likewise, the three uses of the phrase "scale" could probably be condensed into a single usage, with the utilization of a legend for defining the colors. One other minor issue is that the updated plot is not really color-blind compliant.

The "bad" plot has densely overlayed lines, making it difficult to see distinct colored shapes (circle, and left/right arrows). This creates ambiguity. The fact that two different quantities are apparently plotted on the same y-axis is another ambiguity. (It is ambiguous to me that the black lines represent electron number density.) The difference in the spacings of the log scales for the y-axis on either side feels like a distortion. The awkwardly formatted label on the left y-axis is a distraction.

With regard to Tufte's 5 rules, there is an effect size of 1, which may be the only redeeming quality for this plot. The data vs ink ratio is off, as the y-axis labels could probably be condensed. We are also clearly dealing with more than 7 different curves. There is chart junk in the form of random rightward pointing arrows. The plot is not using small multiples, choosing to use cubic centimeters rather than some other measure of volume that would result in smaller values along the right side y-axis. The inclusion of "N" and "O" in the bottom left of the plot is an unnecessary redundancy of information. (Unless it is meant as a way to distinguish from the black lines so as to be color-blind compliant, but the plot contains far too much abmiguity to be helpful to a color-blind person, despite the otherwise helpful distinctly shaped lines.)
